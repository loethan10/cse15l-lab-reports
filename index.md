<p>The initial code for <code>reverseInPlace</code> overwrote the first half of the array without storing its information, causing the inital values in the first half of the array to disappear. This resulted in a palindromic array. The code for the method actually stores the information into a temporary array, and then changes the values, accordingly, so that the initial values are not immediately overwritten.</p>

    <td> <p> The image shown is a screenshot of the server being run. It has taken several strings as an argument ("Hello," "Never," "Gonna," "Give," etc) and concatenated them to a long String, which is implemented to look visually similar to a list. The server utilizes a Java class called StringServer, where it is calling a method <code>handleRequest</code>, which takes a URL as an argument, then parses the URL into several Strings to decode it. The method searches for the String "add-message" after the "/" character, which then looks for a "?=" combination of characters. From there, the rest of the URL is a String that the method uses as an argument to pass to a variable that keeps a running list of all previous Strings passed to the method. When updating the list, a String variable (that holds the list) and an int variable (that keeps track of how many Strings have been passed) are updated. </p></td>
    <td> <p>Similar to the other image, this screenshot shown is one of the server. In this case, however, the server sends out an error statement, since it did not find any valid inputs to either update the running list or to simply show it. The handleRequest method is still called, but since no valid arguments were passed, it returns the statement "404 Not Found!" Furthermore, as a result, no variables were changed.</p></td>

<h4 style="font:Tahoma;"> Part 3 </h4>
  <p style="font:Tahoma;"> I learned many things this week, but the thing that stood out to me most were all the little shortcuts you could use to navigate and/or type commands much faster on the terminal. For example, I learned that control + C (or command, depending on keybinds) stops a server, allowing you to continue typing onto the terminal; this was something I critically needed, as I kept accidentally "softlocking" myself out of the terminal, as I didn't know how to stop a command. Also, I learned that using the up/down arrow keys allows me to re-run commands from before, saving me the hassle of having to retype a command, with a potential typo. Finally, I learned that control + A allows me to go back to the beginning of a line.</p>

<h4 style="font:Tahoma;"> Terminal Commands </h4>
