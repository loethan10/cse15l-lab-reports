<h4 style="font:Tahoma;"> Terminal Commands </h4>
<p style="font:Tahoma;"> For week 1's lab, we learned how to use Edstem, a workspace, which has a terminal that we can use to run commands. Three of these such commands are <i>cd</i>, <i>ls</i>, and <i>cat</i>.</p>

<ul style="font:Tahoma;">
  <li><b>cd</b></li>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> <div style="size: 20 px">This is an example of using the command cd with no arguments. The working directory was /home. Since there was no argument, cd did nothing, as the command is supposed to change the directory to whatever the argument is. The lack of output is intentional.</div></td>
    <td> <div style="size: 20 px">This is an example of using the command cd on a path to a directory as an argument. In this example, cd changed the working directory from /home to /home/lecture1. The lack of output is intentional, and there is no error, as the directory sucessfully changed. </div></td>
    <td> <div style="size: 20 px">This is an example of using the command cd on a path to a file as an argument. However, since cd needs a directory as an argument (to change the directory into whatever was entered), the command produced an error; both inputs in the example above are files, not directories. </div></td>
